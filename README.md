# Rapido_Analysis_Project
I recently worked on a Rapido Power BI Dashboard Project as part of enhancing my data analytics skills. This dynamic dashboard consists of 5 insightful pages:
• Overall: A comprehensive summary of key metrics.
• Vehicle Type: Analyzing performance and trends across different vehicle categories.
• Revenue: Deep diving into revenue generation and growth patterns.
• Cancellation: Understanding cancellation trends,causes and their impact.
• Rating: Tracking customer feedback to ensure quality service.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in Power BI, from data modeling to creating interactive visuals. It's exciting to see how data can empower better decision-making!
